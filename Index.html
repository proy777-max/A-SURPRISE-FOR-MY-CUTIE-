      My love, <br/><br/>
      Every day with you has been a beautiful page in our story. From the way you talk to meâ€”even in your most clumsy, adorable momentsâ€”to the way your eyes light up with dreams, I fall in love with you all over again. ðŸ’—<br/><br/>
      This website is my little gift to you, to celebrate all the love weâ€™ve shared for over a year now. Thank you for choosing me, loving me, and being you. I adore you more than words can ever express. <br/><br/>
      Yours forever,<br/>
      Me ðŸ’•
